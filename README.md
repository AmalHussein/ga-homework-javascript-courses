Javascript Course Registration
<hr/>


Create a course registration system using javascript and html. The course will
have students and one teacher. *We need a Student, Teacher and Course javascript class*

We can create new courses that have a course name. We can create students that will be part of the course and only one teacher that will teach the course.

We are going to use a javascript "Constructor function" to create all courses, students and teachers.
