Javascript Course Registration
<hr/>


Create a course registration system using javascript and html. The course will
have students and one teacher. *We need a Student, Teacher and Course javascript class*

We can create new courses that have a course name. We can create students that will be part of the course and only one teacher that will teach the course.

We are going to use a javascript "Constructor function" to create all courses, students and teachers. Each course, teacher and student will have a method that
will generate it's HTML.

### Some outlines and help.
* Look in the main.js for an outline of the javascript code.
* Look in the index-example.html to see the HTML that will be generated by each object.

## Extra 
* Inherit the Student and Teacher classes from a Person class. * Use the Constructor function inheritence pattern we showed in class*
